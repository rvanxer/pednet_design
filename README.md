## Abstract
Measures of walkability generally do not provide a detailed quantitative assessment of pedestrian infrastructure development prioritization. In this study, a link-based composite measure of walkability and walking is introduced to overcome this limitation. This measure, called ‘pednet score’, is based on a weighted pedestrian network (‘pednet’) made of sidewalks and crosswalks whose edge weights are descriptive of their popularity. Edge popularity is derived from home-based walk trip assignment derived from simulated pedestrian demand. Properties of the pednet score are studied using three hypothetical variants of the pednet in three North American cities, each involving the addition of candidate sidewalk and/or crosswalk segments. It is shown that a strategic selection of these segments based on pednet score can substantially increase walking trips, in some cases up to 236%, and reduce current mean pedestrian trip distances by up to 340 m. A mixed development approach involving both sidewalks and crosswalks also shows considerably higher improvement than those segments considered alone. Results from marginal benefit curves strongly indicate the utility of the pednet score as a measure of link criticality for segment prioritization in pedestrian network design.
